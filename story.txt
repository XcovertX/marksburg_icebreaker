One day Apfelkuchen the Hund was hungry.
He hopped in his Porsche 9/11 Turbo to go grab something to eat. 
He was in the mood for Bratwurst but could only see Brot.
He took a right turn at the Schloss to make his way towards some Döner.
The rotating Döner looked like it was found on the the dirty floor of some Ratskeller.
Instead of eating the Döner, he decided to eat some tasty pretzels at the Biergarten.
